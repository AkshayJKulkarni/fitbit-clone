# Fitbit Clone Web App

## Description
This project is a **Fitbit clone** for the Pixel Plus Hackathon 2025. The goal was to replicate the Fitbit website closely, while adding unique features to improve its functionality and user experience. The web app is designed to display various fitness tracking components such as activity tracking, workout sessions, and health data visualizations.

The original Fitbit design has been maintained to perfection with added enhancements, including:
- **Personalized Activity Dashboard**
- **Advanced Data Visualization**
- **User Engagement Features**

This web app is a **fully responsive** solution that adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

- **Dashboard:** Visualizes key health metrics such as daily step count, distance traveled, and calories burned.
- **Workout Tracker:** Allows users to log different workouts (e.g., running, cycling) and track their progress.
- **Health Metrics:** Users can track heart rate, sleep patterns, and calories burned throughout the day.
- **Customizable UI:** The UI can be personalized with different themes and layouts for better user experience.
- **Graphical Representation:** Advanced charts for visualizing health and fitness progress over time.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3** (Flexbox, Grid)
